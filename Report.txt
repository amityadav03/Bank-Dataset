Data Wrangling and Processing

The process includes Category Indexing, One-Hot Encoding and VectorAssembler.
It indexes each categorical column using the StringIndexer, then converts the 
indexed categories into one-hot encoded variables. The resulting output has the 
binary vectors appended to the end of each row. We use the StringIndexer again to 
encode our labels to label indices. Next, we use the VectorAssembler to combine all 
the feature columns into a single vector column.

Pipeline

We use Pipeline to chain multiple Transformers and Estimators together to specify 
our machine learning workflow. A Pipelineâ€™s stages are specified as an ordered array.


Performance : 

Linear Regression
Accuracy : 0.7666512059369188

Decision Tree
Accuracy : 0.7601770253555967

It is found that linear regression technique has better accuracy. It can further be 
improved by training it on bigger dataset.

Best Performance : 76.66 %
